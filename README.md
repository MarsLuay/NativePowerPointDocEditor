# Native PowerPoint Doc Editor

Native PowerPoint Doc Editor is an Obsidian plugin for opening, searching, and editing `.docx` and `.pptx` files directly inside your vault.

The plugin keeps Office files in place instead of converting them to Markdown. It is designed for school, work, and research vaults where Word documents and PowerPoint decks need small edits, search, review, or quick inspection without leaving Obsidian.

## Features

- Open DOCX files in a native editor view
- Open PPTX files in a PowerPoint-style slide editor view
- Edit and save DOCX files back to the original vault file
- Edit PowerPoint text, tables, charts, shapes, slide objects, and chart data for supported `.pptx` decks
- Search inside DOCX files from Obsidian
- Search within opened PowerPoint decks
- Duplicate, export, and save-as supported documents
- Detect possible save conflicts when a file changes on disk while it is open
- Scan DOCX files for hidden or suspicious text
- Keep DOCX and PPTX handling optional so another plugin can take over those extensions
